<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
  A dictionary of correctly and incorrectly spelled words
  pointing at one or many weighted suggestions
  created from previous user activity
  and backed by algorithmic suggestions.
</p>

<h2>Consumer interface</h2>

<p>The simplest implementation would look something like this:</p>

<pre>
SuggestionFacade facade = new SuggestionFacade(new File("data"));
facade.getDictionary().getPrioritesBySecondLevelSuggester().putAll(facade.secondLevelSuggestionFactory());
...
QuerySession session = facade.getQuerySessionManager().sessionFactory();
...
String query = "heros of mght and magik";
Hits hits = searcher.search(queryFactory(query));
String suggested = facade.didYouMean(query);
session.query(query, hits.length(), suggested);* ...
facade.getQuerySessionManager().getSessionsByID().put(session);
...
facade.trainExpiredSessions();
...
facade.close();
</pre>

<p>Usage can be much more complex than that and would then yeild in better suggestions.</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>
  These are the results from contemplating on the relationships between
  <ul>
    <li>the user a priori (what the users knows to be right)</li>
    <li>user queries (what the user is searching for in the system corpus) and how they are changed during a session in
      quest for one or many specific goals
    </li>
    <li>the results a user inspected and perhaps even classified by taking further actions</li>
    <li>the system corpus (the information available to search in)</li>
    <li>and the system a priori (things the system knows to be right, probably a part of the system corpus you trust to
      be right. E.g. movie titles, but not user comments.)
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  As a user progress in their search for data in a corpus,
  by supplying queries,
  accepting and decline suggestions,
  manually changing queries
  and inspect results in different ways,
  the system tries to find the goals of the event tree
  and suggest these goals to future users with similair behaviour.
</p>

<p>It is not completly wrong to call this a semi-retarded reinforcement learning strategy.</p>

<p>
  When a user requests a suggestion to a query prior unknown to the dictonary,
  second level suggesters will attempt to come up with something.
  These are usually algorithmic and not aware of the dictionary.
</p>

<p>
  In a young implementation, or in one with very little user load,
  the dictionary will more or less act as a cache against the second level suggesters.
</p>

<p>
  Spell corrections, synonyms and acronyms
  are the most common effects I have seen from an active adaptative suggester.
</p>

<p>
  As all queries ever placed are stored in the dictionary (until pruned)
  and the dictionary key is a whitespace and punctuation free version of the query,
  any decomposited or composited typo will be handled.
  For instance, "leonardo da vinci" will get the key "leonardodavinci" and thus suggest
  "leonardo da vinci" in case the input query is "leonardo davinci".
</p>

<h2>Query goal trees</h2>

<p>
  A user session could contain multiple quests for content.
  For example:
  first the user looks for the Apache licence,
  spells it wrong, inspects different results,
  and then the user searches for the author Ivan Goncharov.
</p>

<p>
  In this package they are called different query goals.
</p>

<p>
  It is up to the QueryGoalTreeExtractor implementations to decide what
  events in a session are parts of the same goal,
  as we don't want to suggest the user to check out Goncharov
  when they are looking for the Apache license.
</p>

<p>
  In the default query goal tree extractor,
  nodes are parts of the same goal as their parent when:
  <ul>
    <li>The queries are the same.</li>
    <li>The user took a suggestion from the system.</li>
    <li>The current and the parent queries are similair enough.</li>
    <li>The queries was entered within short enough time.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  User activities are kept track of in a tree of QueryGoalNode:s,
  where each node contains a user query,
  if the current query (node) was a suggestion to a previous user query (node),
  what search results was further inspected,
  when it happend,
  and for how long.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Figure A.</i><br/>
  <img src="doc-files/goalTreeA.png"
       alt="figA">
  <br/>
  User first look for "heroes of knight and magic",<br/>
  followed by "heroes of light and magic",<br/>
  goes back to the first query (knight) and changes that to "heroes of night and magic",<br/>
  followed by "heroes of might and magic".<br/>
  The user adds a comment in the third hit<br/>
  and then inspects the first hit,<br/>
  see that "homm" is a common acronym and searches for that too.<br/>
  Inspects two hits in homm<br/>
</p>

<p>
  <i>Figure B.</i><br/>
  <img src="doc-files/goalTreeB.png"
       alt="figB">
</p>

<p>
  The tree is sent to a trainer that in this case guesses
  "heroes of might and magic" and "homm" seems to be what the user was looking for.
  All non-inspected results are then adapted to suggest the most similar goal.
  The two final goals are adapted to suggest each other.
</p>


<h2>Adaptive training</h2>

<p>
  Adaptive means that the suggestions to a query
  depends on how users previously have been acting.
  This means that the dictionary could be tampered with quite easy by hammering the trainer with data
  and you should therefore try to train only with data from trusted users.
</p>

<p>
  The default trainer implementation works like this:
  <ul>
    <li>If a user accepts the suggestion made by the system, then the score for that suggestion is incresed.
      (positive adaptation)
    </li>
    <li>If a user does not accept the suggestion made by the system, then the score for that suggestion is decreased.
      (negative adaptation)
    </li>
    <li>
      If the goal tree is a single query (perhaps with multiple inspections)
      then adapt negative on suggestion once again.
    </li>
    <li>
      Suggestions are the queries with inspections, ordered by the classification weight.
      All the queries in the goal without inspections will be adpated positive with
      the query with inspections that has the shortest edit distance.
    </li>
    <li>Suggests back from best goal to second best goal. homm -> heroes of might and magic -> homm</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Suggesting</h2>

<p>
  Suggestions are created by the suggester, that navigates a dictionary.
  The default implementation works like this:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Returns highest scoring suggestion available,
      unless the score is lower than the suggestion supression threadshold.
    </li>
    <li>
      If there are no suggestions available, the second level suggesters
      registred to the dictionary are used to produce the suggestions.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the top scoring suggestion is same as the query,
      and the second best is not supressed below threadshold,
      switch the top two suggestions. (This should probably be a setting.)
    </li>
  </ul>
  Ignoring a suggestion 50 times or so with a DefaultTrainer
  supresses a suggestions below the default threadshold.
  If a user manually change a query to a suppresed value
  and thus be suggested again if no other suggestion is considered more important.
</p>

<h2>Second level suggesting</h2>

<p>
  If the dictionary does not contain a suggestion for a given query,
  it will be passed on to any available SecondLevelSuggester,
  usually an algorithmic suggestion scheme
  that hopefully can come up with something.
  When a user accepts such a suggestion
  it will be picked up by the adaptive trainer
  and become a part of the dictionary.
</p>

<h3>A priori corpus dependency</h3>

<p>
  In order for second level suggesters to work they need a corpus that is known to be correct:
  an a priori corpus. This ought to be a small index that only contain text people do not know how
  to spell, i.e. it only consume clock ticks at suggestion time if it is filled with phrases
  people always get right.
</p>

<h3>A priori corpus extraction</h3>

<p>
  By inverting the dictionary and extracting the tokens or phrases people have most problem spelling,
  a pretty good a priori corpus can be created. This will however require a dictionary that has been
  exposed to quite some user activity.
</p>

<h3>Token suggesters</h3>

<p>
  The lowest level of suggestion is single token suggestions,
  and the default implementation is a refactor of the contrib/spellcheck.
</p>

<h4>NgramTokenSuggester</h4>

<p>A refactor of the Lucene crontrib/spellcheck single token ngram suggester</p>

<h3>TokenPhraseSuggester</h3>

<p>
  Combines the output from a single token suggester, applied to each token (word) in a phrase,
  to create possible phrases. In essense this is the same thing as a SpanFuzzyQuery.
</p>

<p>
  For example, the user places the query "thh best game".
  The matrix of similar tokens are:
<pre>
  the best game
  tho rest fame
           lame
</pre>
  These can be combined as:
<pre>
  tho best game
  tho best fame
  tho best lame
  tho rest game
  tho rest fame
  tho rest lame
  the best game
  the best fame
  the best lame
  the rest game
  the rest fame
  the rest lame
</pre>
  A query is created for each combination to find valid suggestions in the a priori index.
  In the default implementation SpanNearQueries are used.
</p>
<p>
  If any of the valid hits contains a TermPositionVector
  it will be analyzed and suggest the query in the order of terms in the corpus.
</p>

<p>
  E.g. query "camel that broke the staw" is suggested with "straw that broke the camel"
</p>

<p>
  <i>todo: if term offsets available and value stored, suggest that value (for cosmetic reasons).</i>
</p>

<h3>MultiTokenSuggester</h3>

<p>
  Works similar to the TokenPhraseSuggester, but uses term queries rather than span near queries,
  used when people place queries where the terms within the query really has nothing to do with each other.
  This second level suggester should have a lower priority than the TokenPhraseSuggester.
